    <h1>Mechanical Engineering</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the world of mechanical engineering!</p>
    
    <h2>Static Equilibrium</h2>
    <p>When an object is in static equilibrium, the sum of all forces acting on it is zero and the sum of all torques acting on it is also zero.</p>
    
    <h2>Stress and Strain</h2>
    <p>Stress is the force per unit area applied to a material, while strain is the resulting deformation of the material.</p>
    
    <h2>Thermodynamics</h2>
    <p>Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its transformations in mechanical systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Fluid Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Fluid mechanics deals with the behavior of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) at rest and in motion.</p>
    
    <h2>Mechanical Vibrations</h2>
    <p>Mechanical vibrations involve the study of oscillations and vibrations in mechanical systems.</p>
